# Random Name Picker

Random Name Picker is a simple program that allows the user to add multiple names to a list, and then pick from them at random. It also allows for simple management of the list. The user can remove the last name they added, display all names in the list, and clear the list.

## Prerequisites

This program requires the .NET 8 SDK, as well as a computer capable of running .NET.

This project is configured to build with Ahead-of-time compilation, a new feature in the .NET SDK. For more information, see [Microsoft's Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/). AOT binaries are NOT portable and won't work between different operating systems!

## Usage

  2. Open a terminal and run `dotnet run`

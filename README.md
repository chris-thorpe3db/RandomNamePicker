# Random Name Picker

Random Name Picker is a simple program that allows the user to add multiple names to a list, and then pick from them at random. It also allows for simple management of the list. The user can remove the last name they added, display all names in the list, and clear the list.

## Prerequisites

Though this program is written in C# which uses the .NET runtime, ahead-of-time compilation is enabled for support on Windows machines without dotnet installed.

However, .NET 8 or later MUST be installed to compile the application.

## Usage

  1. Run `git clone https://github.com/chris-thorpe3db/RandomNamePicker.git` and navigate to the root directory.
  2. Open a terminal and run `dotnet run`
